    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p>
    We are an independent game studio driven by a genuine passion for games. Our goal is simple: to create the kinds of games we love to play ourselves.
    </p>

    <p>
    We focus on strong core mechanics, thoughtful design, and meaningful player experiences. Rather than following trends, we aim to build games with character, clarity, and care.
    </p>

    <p>
    As an indie team, we value creativity, iteration, and hands-on development, believing that great games come from small teams with a clear vision and a lot of passion.
